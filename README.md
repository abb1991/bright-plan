# investment-calc

This is a theoretical business application that takes a predfined, dynamic investment strategy based on investment risk, and returns an ideal investment portfolio based on that risk.


To get started clone the repo, then run `npm install && npm start`.

Then go to `localhost:3000` and you're ready to go. 

Here's an example of the functionality of the web version:
